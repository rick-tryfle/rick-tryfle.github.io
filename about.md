# Bio

Hi @ all! Iam Rick Tryfle. Rockin the turntables since approximately 12 years, now. Man time runs fast. As far as I can remember I played as a support act for Slumvillage, EMC, Stieber Twins.

12 years are a long time. So it may sounds reasonable that one changes his personality and attitudes over the years of such a long journey. I changed not only my artist name from the synonym Petit Regie to Rick Tryfle, but also my style of music, which went along with a huge approvement to my home studio setup.

Now it's time to work, work more and work harder to deliver the rick tryfle sound to your ears. 
There will be an EP or LP coming up.... I keep working on it hard!

Thanks for reading. I'll keep you posted.
